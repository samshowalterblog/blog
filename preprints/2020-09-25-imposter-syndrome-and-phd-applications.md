### The PhD Appication Process

Generally speaking, a PhD is one of the most selective graduate degrees one can pursue. It has one of the highest attrition rates and is the single most common qualification to become a professor. That selectivity will rise and fall with societal demand for the expertise of your field, but overall a PhD is not something one just walks into. As I mentioned in my previous post on [graduate school](https://samshowalterblog.github.io/2020/09/11/education-and-breaking-into-machine-learning.html), a PhD is essentially a job where you get to do whatever you want, and in the process someone (your advisor) will pay for your education and living expenses in the process. In return, you work for your university either as a teaching assistance or a researcher.

### The Imposter Machine

If you have seriously considered a PhD of any kind, but particularly one in Computer Science, then you likely identify with at least one of the following:

1. You love the idea of conducting research and may have some experience doing so.
2. You enjoyed your undergraduate courses and have found yourself 
3. Advancements at the cutting edge of your field excite you.
4. You greatly value the ability to learn new concepts quickly and wish to cultivate it in yourself

If you do not relate to any of these, then you may want to reconsider pursuing a PhD.
