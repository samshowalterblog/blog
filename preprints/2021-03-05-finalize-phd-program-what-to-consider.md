## Its not just about research anymore

If you have followed this blog, you know it was created to shed light on what it is like to become and be a PhD student. Though some of my more recent posts have evolved into more general dicussions applicable to a broad audience, this one will not. Right now, across the country those who have applied to PhD programs will be hearing back from schools. Ideally, at least one of those will be an acceptance. **If this describes you, congratulations!** The rest of this post is for you, and will include tips on how to approach making your final decision.

As the title of this post implies, your final decision should no longer just be about the type of research your potential advisor does. Research is a huge part of what you will work on as a PhD student, but it _won't be your whole life_. You are a human, not a robot taught to churn out publications. Now, you won't be given a PhD just for being human, that is true; only research will give you that. With that said, ignoring your personal needs will surely lead to poor research and a bad time overall in graduate school. The rest of this post discusses ways that you can predict how well a lab's culture fits to your goals and personality. 

## Read the room

A large part of a PhD acceptance is the opportunity to visit the school, free of charge. Usually over a long weekend, the school will pick up your tab and fly you out in style. In my experience, it tends to be the most glamorous part of the entire PhD application process. As you set up your visit and interact with the school, **pay attention to everything**. My sample size is small (I only visited four schools), but I have found that a school's culture - particularly how it regards PhD students - is correlated with how smooth and accommodating visit days can be. Now, there are exceptions to every rule, but pay attention all the same. Is the school being particularly tight on how its budgeting your visit? How quickly do people get back to you if you have a question? Most importantly, what role (if any) does your advisor take in facilitating this process?

Beyond the logistics, remember that a visit day is about **selling you** a PhD. Except on perhaps one occasion, I never felt like a school obscuring less-than-savory aspects of their program. Even so, don't assume that the school is indifferent to your decision. They **chose you**, and no admission-enrollment ratio (percent of admitted students school hopew will enroll) will change that. From this perspective, spend much of your time seeking out relatively unbiased opinions: graduate students.

Inevitably, you will get the chance to hear from a graduate school panel. Overall, I felt that my panels were unbiased, even if I did wonder how these students were chosen. Even more unbiased, however, is asking a random student in your potential department his or her experience. Without any pretenses, they will likely not pull any punches.  

As a semi-interactive, fun exercise, I have transcribed the notes I took from my four visit days, obscuring the names of the schools. These notes represent my personal experience and opinion, and should therefore not be taken as gospel. To perhaps supplement your own decisions, think about these same questions when you go on your visits (which likely will be virtual, and discussed below)

## A case study: Which school would you choose?

**School A**: School A was a fairly well known school for my program of choice. Located in a naturally beautiful and temperate part of the United States, it boasted a fairly large program and exciting research. The first thing I noticed was that the acceptance was impersonal, not tied to any particular advisor. Some schools will simply accept promising students and work out advising later on. Next, I was struck by how difficult it was to set up my visit. Vague instructions about when to arrive and leave ("early afternoon saturday" - _how early? noon? 3?_), paired with unclear reimbursement structure (no clear outline of what and how to reimburse), led to several questions. Fortunately, my emails were answered in a timely and considerate manner.

Fast forward to my visit. In one of our first meetings, the dean of the school made several claims about how they were the "best in the country for innovation," but when asked did not explain what that meant or how that was determined. This contrasted several thrilling research presentations that followed. At the end of the day, I took note of the following:
- Research seems very exciting and publication record is strong
- Many students need to TA for several years, and several must pay out of pocket for at least a semester
- From my interviews, few professors in my field seemed to have funding for new students to do research (meaning I would TA for the forseeable future.)
- No professor seemed inclined to take me as an advisee
- The graduate student panel included a quote saying "to do good research, you need to work at least 70 - 80 hours a week" - _yikes_.

Now, I don't have an issue with hard work, but 80 hour weeks seemed daunting to say the least. Moreover, I was not at all interested in the risk of paying for a PhD out of pocket. On the whole, it felt as if enrolled students would feverishly compete for advisor funding through their first year, while teaching and taking courses.

-------------------------------

**School B**: School B was, on paper, the most prestigious school I was accepted to by far. With a monstrous computer science faculty, the visit day was packed with over a hundred students. This was over double all of my other visit days. Again, I had not interaction with any potential advisors. Setting up the visit was very clearly laid out, obviously standardized to facilitate such a large swell of visitors. However, I was surprised to find that I was assigned a roommate. This was both a blessing and a curse; I was lucky we hit it off, but also had to adjust to sharing a hotel room with a stranger.

Visit day was well conducted and exciting. However, it felt that few of the tough questions students have were addressed (funding, stress, balance, etc.). This was further emphasized by the student panel. Held at 10 a.m. Saturday, many of the students were late... and all of them looked exhausted. No other faculty or staff facilitated the panel. Over the course of an hour we heard from a 6th year PhD student with "about a year and a half to go" and other bleary eyed graduate researchers. Moreover, by then it was clear that the subdomain of research I was interested in exploring was not nearly as prominent in the school.

-------------------

**School C**: School C was a stark contrast from the first two schools. For one, I first heard from a potential advisor at the school instead of getting a general acceptance. Moreover, this person wanted to interview me and discuss my background before making a decision. This request made me nervous but also excited. Since I was interacting directly with someone I may work with, the nature of my PhD experience was automatically much clearer. I saw it as a joint opportunity for each of us to assess the personality of the other. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my discussion, which felt more like grabbing a beer than an interview. Shortly after I received an acceptance. From here, my potential advisor immediately introduced me to his lab, giving me a brief background on each person as well as some contact information. They encouraged me to speak to people throughout the lab about their experiences. I found this an incredibly classy move - no other professor had essentially facilitated an introduction to their lab (frankly, no other potential advisors had reached out at all). 

Moreover, this potential advisor helped serve as a liaison for my visit, helping to direct my questions and being extremely accommodating. After I arrived, I was met by the same set of presentations and speeches from deans int he school. However, the student panel surprised me with their incredibly candid review of their experience, speaking openly about what they didn't like and what they enjoyed. In particular, they noted that while they do amazing research, they are not as renowned as some of their neighbors. I was impressed and put at ease with this honesty. Right after, I got an entire hour to spend with the **entire lab group** that I would join, including some 1-1 time with my advisor as well. This was the only time I had gotten such personalized treatment.

------------------------

**School D**: School D has many commonalities with School C. Advisor reached out, interview, liaison, etc. The primary different I noticed was that this advisor was a young professor whose career was just taking off. Their publication record was extremely impressive, but relatively narrow in scope. By contrast, School C's advisor was an older professor with a larger group and a broader research objective. Both of these individuals were considerate and accommodating throughout the visit.

## Go beyond the classroom and choose a lifestyle

If you had gone on these visits, which school would you choose? For me, I tend to appreciate demonstrated interest and personality matching over prestige or allure. In turn, the impersonal acceptance letters from Schools A and B, coupled with their visits, made them easy exclusions despite their prestige. This, however, left a very difficult decision, one that I chewed on for weeks. 

Having exhausted all of the information I could think of for research and education quality, school's C and D were extremely similar. After speaking with graduate students in both labs, I could have seen myself in both groups. Stuck, I began to consider aspects of my experience external to the education itself. This is where differences began to take shape.
1. School D was far more remote than School C, which would make it hard to travel and see friends/family
2. School C offered a very enticing subsidy for student housing that would guarantee affordable living near campus.
3. My support system (family, friends) was closer to School C
4. The weather was notably better at School C
5. School C appeared to have far better industry connections for graduates

No one should choose a graduate program because of the weather, but it is naive to assume that such things will not impact your experience as a PhD student. You will work hard in graduate school, so it is even more important that you live somewhere that allows you outlets to relax and have fun. After asking myself these questions, it became clear that School C (UC Irvine!) better fit my personality.

## Making virtual decisions in the time of COVID-19

The United States shut down right as my third visit to School C concluded. I was lucky in that I was able to consider most of my options in person and only visited School D virtually. While I only have limited experience with virtual visit days, I imagine I had one of the first virtual visits due to to COVID. Furthermore, I had the unique experience to compare visits immediately before and after COVID changed how we do things.  

My virtual visit to School D was generally an excellent experience; I remain in awe of how well they structured such an event on short notice. There were featured talks, walk-in chat rooms with dozens of faculty members, student panels and break-out room chats, even virtual tours. This structure allowed me more one-on-one time with students and faculty than any other school. The ease-of-use that comes with sitting in front of your computer did confer benefits to my visit, and hopefully will for yours as well.

Unfortunately, COVID has taught all of us that some facets of in-person interaction cannot be replicated. This leads to tough questions, such as how likely you would be to move to a city you haven't visited. There is a reason graduate schools, when able, readily offer to pay for students to spend a few days with them. Trying to explain the content of an image with words is intractable; doing the same with an entire campus, let alone city, is impossible. 

When it became clear I could never visit School D, I consumed everything I could find online. With videos about the campus and city, interviews with people I knew who visited, and phone calls with current students, I did my best to put simulate an in-person visit. However, I still felt largely uncertain about School D. Virtual proxies for in-person experience simply could not compare, heavily biasing my decision towards what I had seen with my own eyes.

This year, virtual experiences will likely be the rule as opposed to the exception. Though virtual visit days do hold advantages, particularly regarding a tailored, more personal experience, my advise to admitted students is **to not forget the impact of the campus and city culture**. For schools that reside somewhere you haven't visited, be aggressive in your consumption of information about the area. The tendency during visits is to ask general questions that may better suit the group than yourself. **I encourage you to fight this urge**. Ask the hard, pressing questions about what life is like, including social outlets, finances, and cultural opportunities. Though it does not feel like it, we will not be remote forever; be sure that it is you, not COVID, who ultimately chooses your program. Best of luck with your final decision, and again, congratulations.
