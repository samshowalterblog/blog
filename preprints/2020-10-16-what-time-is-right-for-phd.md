## A dubious proposition

Picture this: You are a college graduate with a brand new job. Maybe you work for a start up, or a large corporation, or a chic consulting firm downtown. This is your first taste of earning real money and living on your own outside of college. 

One day, someone comes up to you and says: "Hey there! How would you like to cut your earnings in half and work 10+ more hours a week?" Not so appealing? Crudely, this is what returning to graduate school is like after you have spent time in industry. Before you tear up your application, however, hear me out. There are several other reasons why many people (including myself) chose to wait a few years after college to attend graduate school.

## Does timing matter? Dissenting opinions

Your chosen timing for a PhD will certainly have _some_ bearing on your success, though how much it will influence _you_ specifically is uncertain. In general, most recommend enrolling in a PhD program while the concepts you learned in undergrad are relatively fresh in your mind. However, with every rule there are exceptions. For those that actively apply their college instruction at work, it may make sense to actually **wait longer** and allow yourself time to learn from experience. Periodically refreshing the topics you plan to use in graduate school can also bridge this gap (what I did).

In my experience, there are roughly two schools of thought when it comes to  timing a PhD: 
1. Planning to attend right after you finish your undergraduate degree
2. Wait a few (or, in some cases, several) years to enroll, getting industry and real-world experience in the process.

To that end, opponents of either strategy usually state something like the following to deter people from each option (respectively):
1.  Going straight from undergrad to a PhD does not give you adequate time to explore your interests or gain real-world perspective. If you are not 100% sure of your chosen specialty, then you risk losing motivation in your PhD and (_insert scary music_) dropping out.
2.  By going into industry instead of directly to a PhD, you are getting a taste of the good life. What you learned as an undergraduate will begin to ooze our of your brain. Once you re-enroll in a graduate program, the lifestyle adjustment and academic rigor will be so harsh that eventually you will get discouraged and eventually (_insert scary music_) drop out.

To be clear, both of these statements are dramatic and never exactly true on a case-by-case basis. Does that mean there is no truth to them at all? **No**, but there will always be reasons to not do something. What is more important is your reason for attending. Let's start there.

## Understanding your passion

Everyone who is drawn to a PhD has their own unique set of reasons. Perhaps they love learning, or care deeply about pursuing a research career. A PhD is the most specialized degree you can attain, so a deep-seated understanding of your interests is paramount to this interest. Do you need to know the exact specialty you want to pursue in your PhD before you apply? No, but you should know that you do want a specialty and are willing to spend several years pursuing it.

## Reframing the adage of the college dropout

Understanding if you want to be specialized is not an easy task. Many factors are at play that shape your perspective, including:
- You see specializing as a means for you to attain the career you want
- You loved your undergraduate research experiences, and feel that is a strong proxy for graduate school
- A mentor of yours, whom you repect and admire, pursued a PhD and has told you that specialization would be a good match for your interests.

The issue with nearly all of these factors (except perhaps an innate passion for specialty research) is that they are perspectives that may shift over time. One day, you see a way to attain the career you want without a PhD, or your career interests change. After a few years of PhD research you find that your undergraduate experience was not representative of what you do now. As insightful as your mentor was, its possible he or she did not fully understand your personality. Regardless of the reason, many find something that eventually leads them to drop out of their PhD, usually between years 2 and 3.

Why am I mentioning all of this? Because dropping out of a PhD is not the same as dropping out of undergrad or high school. You are already educated, and the likelihood that you can support yourself financially without a PhD is high. **Putting pressure on yourself to complete a PhD for the sake of finishing alone is bad**. Don't immediately consider dropping out a _failure_. If you review your reasons it may be better characterized as a mature decision to re-align your evolving interests. In fact, it is possible to leave a PhD and still get a Master's degree in the process, though you should not enter a PhD with this plan (that is what Master's programs are for).

> Putting pressure on yourself to complete a PhD for the sake of finishing alone is bad

Recognizing that you are not trapped in a PhD is, in my opinion, one of the first things you need to do in order to develop a healthy relationship with the program. PhDs can be very rigorous, isolated, and frustrating, to put it lightly. Realizing that it is your choice to continue allows you to work from your own passion instead of from a fear of failure.

## Weighing the pros and cons

Let's now list out some of the pros and cons for each of these outcomes, starting with **enrolling immediately after undergrad**
- Pros:
    + Coursework still relatively fresh
    + Similar lifestyles (maintin poverty status :) )
    + (Usually) Do not have responsibilities outside of yourself (kids, wife, husand, etc.)
    + Don't waste time in getting your degrees and pursuing your passion
- Cons:
    + Lack perspective gained from an independent, non-college lifestyle
    + Don't know what a full-time industry job is like (tough to know that you won't like it)
    + Lack any savings to fall back on to pad PhD budget


Now, let's consider waiting. In most cases, people wait between 1-5 years before returning. Waiting longer that this poses its own set of problems that I do not feel qualified to speak to, so let's consider this case in isolation.
- Pros:
    + Understand the rigors and lifestyle of someone working in industry
    + Develop soft-skills that may be beneficial in graduate school (proactivity, collaboration, etc.)
    + Have built up some savings from working to assist a PhD budget
    + Get extra time to explore and determine your passion if you do not know it
- Cons:
    + Much harder lifestyle adjustment compared to when you were a student
    + More likely to have additional commitments outside of yourself (kids, wife, husand, etc.)
    + Course material no longer as fresh as it was as a student

To different people, each of these lists may grow longer or shorter; only the most general characteristics of each path are listed. In truth, only you can figure out the perfect route for your specific situation, though sometimes it helps to hear someone else explain their logic.

## Waiting for a sign: Why I chose to wait to get my PhD

As an undergraduate, I changed majors 3 times. When it comes to academic decisions, I am far from decisive. However, what I lacked in decisiveness I made up with conviction. It took me a long time to find my passion for Machine Learning as an undergraduate, but since then I have not wavered.

My reason to wait to pursue a PhD then may come as a surprise. If I am so convicted, why not enroll right away? First, I wanted to see if I could enter the field of Machine Learning and get my dream job without a PhD. When I got an offer to do Data Science at West Monroe Partners, I felt that this would be a good start. Though my work would not necessarily be cutting edge, perhaps it would fit my interests well enough for me to forgo graduate school.

Secondly, I wanted to give myself time to explore Data Science in other industries. Depending on the field, Machine Learning can take many different forms. I saw consulting as a chance to taste all of them without sticking with one indefinitely.

Moreover, I felt I could further improve my candidacy by completing large-scale industry projects and learning more about machine learning through independent, open-source projects. Though I cannot prove it, I do think that my industry accomplishments helped my candidacy. In fact, some professors look for industry experience specifically.

Lastly, I wanted to save up some money and provide myself a bit of financial freedom in case I found graduate school was a bad fit. Similarly, if I found that a Master's program better suited my needs, then I would have a little capital to put towards my tuition, cutting down on any future loans I might take.

## Coming Up: The First 3 Months - What to Expect as a PhD Studen

So you have picked a year, chosen your programs, gathered your materials, been accepted, and enrolled in a program. Congratulations! My next post will align with my first three months as a graduate student, and I will give you an in-depth look of what I experienced. Hopefully, my first few months can give you an idea of what to expect as well as how to prepare.
