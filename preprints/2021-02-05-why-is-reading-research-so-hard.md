## Reader's block: Perspectives on formalized education

Have you ever wondered why we go to college? By the time we graduate high school, nearly all of us can read, write, and understand most math fundamentals. What then is the purpose of spending thousands of dollars to have someone else walk you through more advanced concepts? Why not simply read the textbooks on your own?

Far from a trick question, there are certainly pros and cons to both choices; Personally, I think that college is a smart decision for many. Professors, experts in their field, ideally give their students a look beyond course content into something more. Insights stemming from how experts think about and solve problems are at times more valuable than the content itself. Despite how codified knowledge has become, there are still tips and tricks that will inevitably be passed experientially and can't be found in books. 

Yet, who are professors going to learn from? Well, with their strong, sound bank of knowledge, they often self-direct their learning, digesting new concepts on their own. Most often, these "new concepts" are found in research publications that bring together existing knowledge and new ideas in valuable ways. The act of becoming excellent at self-guided learning - reading, understanding, and producing new research publications - has been formalized in the Doctorate of Philosophy, or PhD.
