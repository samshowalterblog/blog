## What do you love about your favorite IDE?

For software developers, an IDE can make or break productivity. The more familiar you are with an IDE's specific structure, shortcuts, and nuances, the better you will be at building software in general. Some choose IDEs specific to a language, such as PyCharm or IntelliJ. Others prefer simpler text editing tools like Sublime, Atom, or Notepad++. Whatever you personally choose, I am willing to bet that if you have worked with it for awhile that you would live and die by that editor. In some ways it becomes and extension of ourselves at work, school, any time we are writing code or editing text.

Yet, certainly there is _something_ that your current IDE does not offer that might be helpful. At the same time, unless you are a super-user who scours documentation tip to tail, it is likely that you are not aware of all the shortcuts, tips and tricks an IDE has to offer. This is indeed part of the fun of development - there is always something new to learn. Why then, you might ask, should you switch at all?  

##  Why I decided to switch to Vim

For years, I worked primarily with Sublime Text editing. Though Sublime's initial learning curve is small, it provides an immense amount of flexibility and complexity in the form of `Install Packages` and custom build systems. In fact, that is what initially drew me to Sublime. With a push of a button, `CONTROL-B` to be precise, you can build your current file with any build system you have set up. If you wanted to work in Java, just drop down to the Java build system. The same goes for Python, C++, Markdown, and anything else. Sublime's structure is built around minimalism and simplicity, with more than a few powerful tricks packed in (`CONTROL-D` for multiple cursors is one of my favorites).

Yet, as I started graduate school I noticed that I would repeat many of the same commands to complete just one assignment. As an example, if I needed to build a predictive model, the overhead I suffered to debug it grew as I progressed in the project. If I was nearing completion, I might need to run several build up steps to even test what I was currently working on. This migh take only a minute, but I noticed that in many cases I would need to re-run this step several times to debug my code completely.

With time, I wised up and started storing intermediate steps in Jupyter notebooks, porting out features only when I was fairly certain they would accomplish what I intended. Yet, this led to lots of clicking back and forth between Jupyter and Sublime, straining my hands and slowing me down.
