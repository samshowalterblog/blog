## Striking a balance with imbalance

Rounding out your life is never easy, no matter what you do or how old you are. There are only so many hours in the day, and no immediately clear guide on how to spend them beyond your own wants and the advice of others. What makes balance particularly complicated for a PhD student can be tied to the rigor of the program itself.

For one, there are few programs that rival a PhD in length. Technically, since a PhD is a potentially unbounded academic degree, nothing surpasses it. Moreover, PhDs by their nature tend to facilitate frustration and isolation if not properly managed. This makese sense - it is **frustrating** to try and extend human knowledge in a subject; the likelihood of repeated failure (with the best intentions) is high. Similarly, as you extend deeper into a field of study the number of individuals who share your expertise progressively shrinks, **isolating** you with the problems a research in your field finds at the frontier of knowledge.

Now, this does not mean you won't love your PhD; in fact, many cherish that experience for the rest of their lives. However, in my limited experience I believe that the defining trait that separates challenging v. soul-crushing is perspective.

As [Dr. Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/ways-to-fail-a-phd/) pointed out (if you do not already read his work, follow him), a PhD is no 9-to-5 job. In his own words, a Phd "is a monastic experience", more akin to a "jealous hobby" than a career. To get a PhD, you have to work **hard**, but this does not mean you have to set aside all your other interests and aspirations.

## Selective perfectionism: Learning to satisfice

Most of us have heard the word _perfectionist_ before. In fact, if you are reading this I am willing to bet those in your life have called you a perfectionist from time to time. PhD's tend to attract perfectionists, those that strive for complete excellence in their work. It is this trait that pushes you to excel in your coursework and to consider further improving yourself with graduate education. By contrast, relatively few have heard of **satisficing**.

Satisficing as I am using the term is the act of defining a threshold of acceptaility for a task and ceasing work as soon as you exceed it. As a perfectionist, I can tell you that it is one of the most unintuitive acts I do on a day-to-day basis. "What you you mean stop? There are so many other things to do!"

With a PhD, it is important to remember that there will always be something more that you can do. There are infinite approaches to consider, dozens of realistic methods with which you could shape your publication (or revise it if you are rejected). At some point, it is important to reflect on what you have done so far and consider moving on. Some research may yield a dead-end, and striving for perfection with every idea you have may lead to frustration more often than success.

Still, perfectionism has its place. If you have cultivated a new domain of research that you are exploring and refining for publication, it is beneficial to pore over your ideas since you already have some indication they have promise. In this situation, it also benefits you to be your own harshest critic, making sure your work is robust enough to stand up to the scrutiny of others. Conversely, a less abstract example of satisficing would be your coursework in your first few years. 

Though you do need to maintain a certain GPA to graduate, a PhD is a research degree. To get it, you need to do research, and a lot of it. Spending hours and hours refining your class assignments to get an A instead of an A- may have less of a marginal return than simply taking the A- and diverting your attention back to research. This is a difficult dance, and I will never tell someone to intentionally do shoddy work, but keeping marginal benefit in mind during a PhD appears quite important for a timely graduation.

## Making ends meet: Living on a student's budget

The finances of a PhD student are a fascinating mix of real-world economics and academic subsidy. Stipend's vary from student to student and across programs, but suffice it to say, you will not be making very much.

In fact, there is so much variation here that it is difficult to write a succinct, general blog post about it. Instead, I will briefly touch on my experience and compare it to what I have heard about other institutions.

At the end of the day, the goal of every _person_ (not just student) is to earn more money than they spend in order to live. Easier said than done? Yes, absolutely. During the school year, most universities only allow graduate students to work 20 hours a week, known as a **50% appointment** (either TA - Teaching Assistant or GSR - Graduate Student Researcher). Generally, this income will come in once a month at around $1,600 - $2,200, net of taxes. 

Obviously, with an income like that the number of extravagant trips and 401k contributions you make drops to near-zero. However, schools generally create their stipend to ensure that the student can live a modest but comfortable life. Some of the ways that UCI does this for their graduate students include:

**On-campus, heavily subsidized housing for graduate students**: Orange county is no cheap place to live, and UCI knows this. Their housing package includes parking, utilies, and internet for a greatly reduced price relative to the market. Still, this will probably eat up 25% - 40% of your income.

**Food Distributions**: For students that demonstrate a financial need, a food pantry offers fresh produce and other staples to assist in student grocery budgets.

**Student Perks**: Most colleges have this, but UCI does offer premium subscriptions to things like Microsoft Office, Zoom, the New York Times, etc. while students are enrolled.

Now, before I continue I want to remark on my privilege. Not many schools offer housing for graduate students, who otherwise have to fetch something at the market rate (which can be very, very high). This is the number one strain I have heard from students. In some situations rent can comprise 60 - 70% of a student's income. Take these considerations seriously. **Include expenses and cost of living as a factor for deciding on a graduate school**. No one can get a PhD if they starve in the process.

In order to keep track of your spending, I recommend creating a budget spreadsheet. This is an easy and fairly painless way to make sure you are tracking all of the money you are spending. When I first started doing this, I was shocked at how everything added up. It was far too easy to assume to understand you finances when you actually do not, so do yourself a favor and track your receipts. Data will tell you (bluntly) how frugal you truly are.

## Relationships and Support Systems

Beyond school, money, and research, it is important to keep time for cultivating and maintaining a social support system. I myself did not fully understand the importance of this until I started my PhD. To put it lightly, there will be days that are highly discouraging. You will make frequent and sometimes very costly mistakes. This happens to everyone and is part of the process, but that doesn't mean it is not discouraging or taxing emotionally.

On those days where things have been going poorly since you woke up, it is often very helpful to have a friend, partner, or familiar member to lean on and discuss your situation. Listen to their input closely, since you are likely to be too deep in the trees to see the forest around you. Stay diligent with your work, but when a friend invites you out to lunch or on a trip, don't always shirk them simply because you are worried about your work. Remember, work will still be there, and it will never be asking you out to lunch.

## The bottom line: Your health

A PhD is rarely easy, but nothing would make it more difficult than poor health. Sometimes it can be easy to forget about taking care of the small things as we rush around as busy students (this goes for undergrads as well). What you eat, how much you sleep, and the type of activities you do throughout the day add up, for better or for worse. Do yourself a favor, and try and keep yourself tied to a **loose routine**. Perhaps you take up walking before dinner, while you chew on some ideas you have for research. Maybe getting a bike ride or a gym session in before classes begin is more your thing. Regardless, don't neglect yourself. A PhD will come and go, but your health sticks with you always.

To that end, do not just consider the physical aspect of your health. Mental health is arguably the most important aspect of having a well balanced life. As mentioned in the section above, when you are struggling, lean into your relationships. If you do not feel comfortable doing that, find a new outlet to discuss what you are going through. Many universities offer a variety of mental health and wellness services, so take advantage of them! No degree is worth your happiness, nothing is.

## Coming Up: A Day in the Life of a First-year PhD Student

By the time I had applied to PhD programs, I had a huge bank of knowledge spanning programs across the country. Surprisingly, I still had little intuition for what a PhD student's life is like day-to-day. In order to fill this gap, I will be publishing a timeline of how my time has been spent so far in the first year of my Machine Learning PhD.
