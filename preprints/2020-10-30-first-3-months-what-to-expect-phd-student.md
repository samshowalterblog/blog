## A long time coming

In an effort to stay safe (and some money) while migrating my life from Chicago to UCI on the West Coast, I decided the most prudent thing to do would be to pack up everything I could in my car and drive the whole way there. Graciously, my mother agreed to be a co-driver. While we rolled through 34 hours and 2,300 miles of driving, we both got a bit nostalgic about our lives so far. For my mother, she was months away from losing her four children to different programs and becoming an empty nester for the first time in her life. For me, I was starting a new life across the country in a state I had visited for less than 24 hours previously.
