## Keeping your head above water: The initial adjustment to graduate school

The graduate application process, like most academic programs, takes a long time. For roughly a year, you are either researching schools, filling out applications, waiting for responses, choosing between schools that accepted you, visiting them, and waiting for enrollment to begin. Because of this delay as well as the additional effort it took to move across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic (I drove. It took a very long time.), my arrival to campus felt strangely anticlimactic. 

However, suddenly things began to take shape. Zoom calls with my advisor quickly transitioned from pleasantries to research goals. Emails originally  filled with local hikes and restaurant recommendations now came with half a dozen publications attached for me to read. Compared to undergrad and industry, where full meetings (classes) were spent giving an overview of the topic, this felt like being tossed in an ocean of technicality.

Thus, my learning curve as a new graduate researcher was steep. When the state of the art in your field has recently been published in a conference in the last month, tutorial videos or articles explaining its nuances are probably unavailable. Moreover, these articles are written for researchers, by researchers. This felt like the wild west of learning: no holding back on technicality that may span multiple disciplines.

## Becoming a sponge: Reading for your life

Most of us come to expect a few jitters when we start a new opportunity. I had felt them many times before: new jobs, schools, even new cities. However, something about my transition to a PhD student felt different. From the beginning, it was clear my advisor was expecting me to absorb this information independently. No classes were going to be held on my research topic. Moreover, this research horizon - the edge of human knowledge - is constantly changing.

Thus, I did the only thing I could in that moment, **read everything**. The first article I read took my over three hours, split between reading and looking up the bits of the paper I did not understand. The next one had some conceptual overlap and went faster, just under two. On each of these articles, I kept a sheet of notes and I logged in a spreadsheet. 

After a few days, the six publications were done, but I was far from understanding the full scope of my research topic. Instead of going back to my advisor right away, I peeled through the references of the first six papers and made a new reading list. Once I had absorbed 5 or 6 of these, I repeated the process, generally moving back in time.

After roughly two weeks of reading, my advisor had a new request: find some of the state of the art Machine Learning methods in this field, and implement them in a way that they can be compared. Though I was slighly anxious about finally having something to produce, it now seemed tractable. The terms, concepts, papers, and authors my advisor referenced were now vaguely familiar. At the very least, I knew where to go if I needed to learn more. It was after this Monday afternoon meeting that I began to feel confident as a student researcher. Despite the daunting nature of academic literature, I had absorbed enough to tread water.

## Don't skimp on the soft skills: Research is a team sport

Fast foward three more weeks, and I had a working piece of software that integrated many of the SOTA (state of the art) novelty detection systems for deep learning (henceforth called the "system", since all that is a mouthful). As this sytem got larger and larger, less time needed to be dedicated to bulding it. However, now people became more curious about this system. What kind of experiments can it run? How do you interpret the results? Would it be possible to add $X$ feature?

From here on out, much more of my time was spent as a project (or even product) manager. Providing different lab members access to the code, explaining experimental results, and giving presentations to our funders quickly absorbed the time that was originally spent developing the system in the first place.

For the first time, I felt like my skills as a consultant were shining through my work as a PhD student. Militant organization, clear communication, and timely responses to questions are all essential traits as a researcher, more so than I expected. 

Instead of walking through code or papers, I would draw up a few PowerPoint Slides for each meeting with my group, sharing it with them afterwards. All of my code was managed through source control, which made adding new developers trivial. Though these seem like simple, quick tricks, they are worth their weight in gold. Anyone who has had to manually merge a nasty code conflict or painstakingly attempt to clarify a technial presentation knows that these little backstops can save you hours of time in the long run.

## Balancing coursework: Forget (some of) what you learned in undergrad

As a college student, your job is to learn a subject well enough that you can get a good (or even excellent) job in your field of choice upon graduation. How do employers determine the strength of your candidacy? There are many ways - projects, competitions, writing samples - but there is one single indicator that stands above the rest: GPA. GPA isn't everything. It is a cruel truth that an excellent GPA on its own will get you nothing more than your foot in the door at most prestigious companies. What's worse, a low GPA makes getting a competitive job exponentially more difficult directly out of school.

Suffice it to say, GPA is important. The saying "student first, [insert other focus/sport] later" exists for a reason. The majority of your tuition costs go towards classes. Maximizing your grades in these classes signals to employers that you are willing to put in the effort, perhaps the most important trait anyone can have in any situation.

However, as a PhD student you are no longer measured by your GPA, but by your research output and expertise within a field. This goal is not entirely orthogonal to courses, but they are not completely aligned either. You do not just develop world class expertise overnight, and classes tend to be an efficient means of learning for most people. With that said, classes alone will not give you world-class expertise, and some courses may require coursework that is more time-consuming that 

I personally fell into this trap when I started my coursework. As an undergrad I placed a very high priority on courses. Even if it was half a letter grade difference, I would put in that extra time. As a PhD student, I started to do the same, and quickly fell behind on my research. Over the last month, I have begun shifting my focus to better balance these two objectives, but frankly I have a ways to go. Changing mindsets after 16+ years of focusing on grades is easier said than done, but I already feel like I can better manage my schedule week-to-week.

## Keeping time for you while cultivating efficiency

A PhD is a grind, no two ways about it. It is also a marathon. Tearing out of the gate and pulling all nighters to get ahead is a losing strategy. Don't be afraid to challenge yourself and little and step out of your comort zone, just don't step too far. Everyone has a story of someone close to them burning out after a few months of pushing too hard, be it research, classes, or industry work. Every week (or even better, every day) keep some amount of time that you will dedicate to keeping yourself balanced and happy. Make this non-negotiable. Deadlines or not, take a half hour to do something that helps you decompress.

For the remaining 23.5 hours of the day, my general recommendations based on my experience are listed below.
- Find out the minimum amount of sleep you need to sustain your schedule, and get it. every. night. You will thank yourself later
- Don't push yourself too hard at the beginning. People don't go from their couch and run a marathon straight away. Progressively incorporate more and more work into your schedule every week until you feel you are keeping pace with (or exceeding) your obligations
- Almost everyone could be more efficient and still get the same amount of sleep. Be honest with yourself when you start to feel like you are falling behind. Am I on my phone when I am studying? Do I check every alert that pops up on my computer (I did, so I silenced everything while I was working). Its not easy, but focus is a teachable skill. Cultivate it and you will be glad you did.
- Find the schedule that just slightly exceeds what you think you will have energy for in a given day. Every few days, make your schedule slightly less packed (recovery day). After a few cycles of this, add something small an manageable to your schedule, and repeat. You will be surprised by how quickly you adapt.

When I first started my work as a PhD student, some days I would finish work and be completely drained. Physically, mentally, the work felt exhausting. I had doubts, but also remembered that most things get easier with practice and time. Be deliberate with practicing efficiency, but also patient with yourself. No one is perfect.

### Coming Up: Money Time and Happiness - Balancing life as a PhD Student

The previous section poses an interesting and more general question: How does one maintain holistic balance while completing a PhD? Life is so much more than classes and research, particularly for those with external committments (partner, children, etc.). The answer to this question certainly varies with personal situations, but my next post will discuss how the logistics of being a PhD student generally shapes personal life.
