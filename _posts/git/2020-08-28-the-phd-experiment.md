### Welcome 

Two weeks ago, I started a PhD in computer science with a focus on machine learning (ML), a dream of mine for years. 

Machine learning has been exploding in the last decade, yet the path to entering this field still remains obscure. *Why*? Companies are begging for ML talent. Colleges and companies alike seem to be conjuring up new Data Science curricula every week. Companies have been built around ML competitions, certifications, software, you name it. Yet, questions like:

- What does it take to get a top-tier machine learning job?
- How do I learn machine learning if I am no longer in school and want to switch jobs?
- Is an online education (Coursera, Udemy, DataCamp, etc.) a sufficient replacement for in-person teaching?
- PhD v. Masters' v. Bachelors' -- Are any (or all) of these necessary for machine learning?

are still not easy to answer. If you are interested in machine learning but are not sure where to start, **welcome**, this blog is for you. 

In this blog I will talk about my personal (roundabout) path to machine learning, trends at the cutting edge of the field, and what life is like as a PhD student.

### What will I write about?

I started this blog primarily for personal benefit. Just like most, I do not have all the answers when it comes to machine learning. However, over time I have picked up little insights from my experience with the field and want to share those. I also intend to document my progression as a PhD student to give future PhD students an explicit, of what to expect.

Accordingly, my posts will be roughly grouped into the following categories. 

- Updates on my PhD research and experience as a student
- Distillations of past experiences with Machine Learning in industry
- Short explorations of exciting, new, or cutting edge technology
- Notes on how to be a productive

For now, these are ordered based on their likelihood of occurrence. Over time, I may garner new interests that warrant posts of their own.

### A little about me

I am a first-year PhD student in machine learning. I am studying at UCI in Padhraic Smyth's [DataLab Group](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/research_group.html). Before this, I was a Data Science Consultant for a mid-sized firm out of Chicago. There, I worked on some interesting projects related to FinTech and NLP. Right out of college, I worked for a national lab as a quantum computing research on a temporary fellowship. I received my undergraduate education from DePauw University, a small liberal arts college in Indiana. For more information, you can visit my website [here](https://samshowalter.github.io/#about).

### My Non-traditional Path to Machine Learning

When I was working as a consultant, the single question I got asked the most was: *"how did you break into this field"*? To be honest, I have never felt my answer was sufficiently informative. I usually start by mentioning my interest in math, something I decided to study in college. However, I did not start coding until I was a junior in college, nor had I taken a single computer science course until then. My job right out of college was not explicitly in Data Science, nor was any of my coursework in school. 

Indeed, 90% of my college Machine Learning came from online forums, blogs, and tutorials. Generally, I would find a project that seemed interesting and try to replicate it. Along the way, I would do my best to pick up the knowledge (programming, mathematics, architecture) I needed to complete it well. I do not necessarily condone this approach - learning in such an ad-hoc way can lead to lots of confusion. For me though, it was exciting to chase after some new technology, learning whatever I could along the way.

Now that I am learning machine learning in a more structured environment, I felt it would be beneficial to organize my thoughts on the field as well.

### Coming Up

In the next few weeks I will be releasing a post about the ML opportunities available for people with different levels of education, from no college all the way up to a PhD. It will also cover my personal experience with applying for a PhD, including everything I learned about how to determine a good advisor, narrow a list of schools, and prepare a strong application.
