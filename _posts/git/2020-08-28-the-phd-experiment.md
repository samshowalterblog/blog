### Welcome

Two weeks ago, I started a PhD in computer science with a focus on machine learning (ML), a dream of mine for years. However, since I submitted my application last December, one thing has become very clear: I have no idea what to expect.

machine learning has been exploding in the last decade, yet the path to entering this field still remains obscure. Why? Companies are begging for ML talent. Colleges and companies alike seem to be conjuring up new Data Science curricula every week. Yet, there is still no consensus , leading to questions like:

- What does it take to get a top-tier machine learning job?
- How do I learn machine learning if I am no longer in school and want to switch jobs?
- Is an online education (read: Coursera, Udemy, DataCamp, etc.) a sufficient replacement for in-person teaching?
- PhD v. Masters' v. Bachelors' -- Are any (or all) of these necessary for machine learning?

If you are interested in machine learning but feel you don't have all the answers about the field, **welcome**. In this blog I will talk about my personal (roundabout) path to machine learning, trends at the cutting edge of the field, and what life is like as a PhD student. Over time, perhaps you and I can answer some of these questions together. I give no guarantees, but my hope is to post something new every few weeks until I (hopefully) graduate.

### What to Expect

I started this blog primarily for personal benefit. Just like most, I do not have all the answers when it comes to machine learning. However, over time I have picked up little insights about what it means to be a Data Scientist. Now that I am a PhD student, I plan to use this blog a 

Over the next few years, I will be writing about what it is like to complete a PhD, from application to (hopefully) dissertation. I will likely also add short, ancillary posts on things I find interesting or beneficial, including:

- How to optimize your development environment 
- Favorite software for ML research
- Quantum computing
- The differences between being an academic researcher and an industry practitioner.

### A Little About Me.

As I mentioned, I am a first-year PhD student in machine learning. I am studying at UCI in Padhraic Smyth's DataLab Group. Before this, I was a Data Science Consultant for a mid-sized firm out of Chicago. There, I worked on some interesting projects related to FinTech and NLP. Before that, I worked for a national lab as a quantum computing research fellow. For more information, you can visit my website [https://samshowalter.github.io/#about](here).

### Coming Up

In the next few weeks I will be releasing a post on what the PhD application process is like. It will cover everything I learned about how to determine a good advisor, narrow a list of schools, and prepare a strong application.
