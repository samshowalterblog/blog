# The PhD

Generally speaking, a PhD is one of the most selective graduate degrees one can pursue. By nature, it is for those who want to become **experts** in a discipline.  It has one of the highest attrition rates among graduate programs and is the single most consistent qualification to become a professor. Admission selectivity will rise and fall with demand for the expertise of your field, but overall a PhD is not something one just walks into. As I mentioned in my previous post on [graduate school](https://samshowalterblog.github.io/2020/09/11/education-and-breaking-into-machine-learning.html), a PhD is essentially a job where you get to explore your interests freely, and in the process someone (your advisor) will pay for your education and living expenses. In return, you work for your university either as a teaching assistant or a researcher. In this time, usually 5 years, you will be paid very little but also get an education for free. In addition, this is not a run-out-the-clock type of degree. To graduate, you must **earn it**. That means publishing papers and extending the frontier of knowledge in some small way.

# Before you apply: Is a PhD right for you?

If you have seriously considered a PhD of any kind, then you likely identify with at least one of the following:

1. You love the idea of conducting research and may have some experience doing so.
2. You enjoyed your undergraduate courses and remain curious about more advanced topics you do not yet understand.
3. Advancements at the cutting edge of your field excite you.
4. You greatly value the ability to learn new concepts quickly and wish to cultivate it in yourself

If you do not relate to any of these, then you may want to reconsider pursuing a PhD. Graduate admission is selective, and PhD admissions are particularly rigorous. Some people apply repeatedly before eventually gaining acceptance and applications are time consuming as well as expensive.

# The PhD Application: All components to consider

The PhD application is usually completed by December of the year before matriculation. That is, if you want to start in August 2021, you would submit your applications in December 2020. These applications take quite a long time to put together and refine, so be sure to **start early**.

The exact format of PhD applications varies from school to school, but generally you will need the following:
- GRE scores
- Personal statement, no more than 2 pages
- Occasionally, a shorter research statement
- A minimum of **three** recommendations letters
- Updated resume of CV
- General application and personal information
- Formal transcript from your previous education

These materials are ordered by the amount of time they took me to complete. Effort will vary by person, but generally you can expect to spend 90%+ of your time on the top four bullet points. For each of these, details are added below.

## GRE Scores

The GRE is an interesting test in that it is conceptually as simple or simpler than the ACT / SAT tests you took to get into undergrad. However, the GRE has a much more rigid structure. Each section - Quantitative, Reading, and Writing - has questions that are posed very similarly. It is a multiple choice test, aside from the essay, and takes a few hours to complete. 

Now, the important thing to remember here is this: **A great GRE score alone will not get you into an amazing graduate school, but a bad GRE score _will_ keep you from being accepted**. Unfair? Absolutely. Is it an arbitrary test that has no bearing on being a good graduate student? You bet. The test is tedious and not intellectually challenging. It is, in effect, an initiation for graduate school applications to show that you are serious about the process.

I studied hard for this. Some may not need to, but I did in order to get a good score. I even took it twice before I was happy. Why? Successful PhD applicants tend to have very high scores. In the top 5% for all sections, generally. Now, you can absolutely get into graduate school without an astronomical GRE. However, it is used as a weed-out metric if you and another applicant are very similarly qualified. **Plan to take this as an undergraduate if you can.** Once you are out of school, studying monotonous GRE material will feel much more difficult.

## Personal Statements

Plain and simple, this is the **single most important part of your application that you can control**. This statement allows you to show the reviewers your qualifications, passion, and personality. Now, this is __very__ different from your undergraduate admissions essays. Do not add flowery jargon or syntax. Above all else, be clear and concise. Most successful statements are 2 pages at most, and cover the following information, in order:
- Why you want a PhD and a quick statement on why you are qualified
- An overview of your research and industry experience related to the PhD
- Your academic background and performance in school - feel free to add relevant extracurriculars here
- A closing statement where you personalize your essay to the institution, naming a few lab groups that are particularly interesting to you

This is a lot to pack into a few pages. Iterating on this statement can take weeks; be sure to have your peers review it as well as anyone you can contact who has gone to graduate school and been through the same process successfully.

Sometimes, schools will also ask for a short statement on your research interests. This tends to be no more than a page and is best written as a progression of your interests over time, sprinkling your experiences within.

## Recommendation Letters

Recommendation letters are probably **the most important part of your PhD application, period**. A glowing review from a mentor or advisor can greatly boost an applicant's candidacy. In particular, you should look to find people that advised you as an undergraduate with your coursework, research, or both. Industry references can be highly beneficial as well if your work is particularly technical. However, from what I have seen an academic recommendation is stronger than one from a boss you had while working.

Be sure to reach out to your recommenders early! Like you, they are almost certainly busy people. Also be sure to provide them all the materials they may need to write your application, including your:
- Resume
- Transcript
- Personal statement
- Schools you are applying to

## Remaining Pieces

Aside from these main components, you will still need to actually fill out the application provided by each school. Each of these may have different forms, portals, and deadlines. Do yourself a favor and **make a spreadsheet to track your progress**. 

Moreover, your undergraduate GPA will be quite important for your graduate candidacy. You do not need a 4.0, but it should be clear you have a strong grasp of the material you studied. Interestingly, **you do not need to be a Computer Science major as an undergraduate**. I was not. It helps if you are, but above all graduate schools want to see that you are passionate and driven. With that said, PhD applications are selective enough that most schools require completion of basic computer science courses, usually the equivalent of a computer science minor. If you do not have these, you either have to demonstrate you understand that material or take additional courses before you apply.

# Imposter Syndrome

That is a ton of content for a single application, and at times it can feel impossible to create a good one. A quick survey of online forums will yield people boasting about their perfect GRE score, existing publications in a top-tier conference, and positions at top technology companies. Take it from me, **ignore these posts**. Are there PhD applicants with these attainments? Yes, but after these 10 students get their pick of graduate school, the rest of us non-perfect applicants get a turn. 

My personal application was not particularly strong in a traditional sense. I went to a non-target liberal arts college where I did not major in Computer Science. I also did not have any formal publications in Machine Learning. However, what I recommend if you also feel shaky about your applications is this: **address your weaknesses**.

In my personal statement, I discussed my background in its entirety, weaknesses and all. I used this information to show how and why I was dedicated to pursuing a PhD in this field. I talked about the undergraduate groups I started around Data Science, the initiative I took as a consultant to grow Machine Learning interest at the company, and everything I learned in the process. Above all, what professors want to see in a PhD applicant is that **you are driven and passionate**. Even with imperfect qualifications, you can absolutely communicate that.

To that end, a bonus-point opportunity of sorts is to reach out to professors individually. **However**, do your research! Some professors are too busy to talk before you have been accepted by the school. **Do not reach out a professor if they explicitly say not to on their website**.

# Setting Incremental Goals

Our final topic in this post has to do with how to eat the elephant that is the PhD application, one bite at a time. If you're reading this, you are likely already busy with something, be it school or a job. Balancing all of this can feel impossible at times. 

What worked for me was the following: every day, set aside some amount of time to work on your application. Even if it is half an hour, make the application a consistent priority. These "small bites" keep the application fresh in your mind without burning you out. Also, be sure to track your progress on all of the application components and prioritize accordingly. Most of all though, don't quit on the application. No one wants to refine their personal statement for the 10th time, but that effort will pay off in the long run. No one wants to apply twice if they don't have to!

# Coming Up: Choosing Schools and Advisors

The PhD application is a long process, but making a successful application is attainable with the right planning and dedication. In the next few weeks, I will extend this further and discuss how to determine schools and advisors that would be a good fit for your interests.
