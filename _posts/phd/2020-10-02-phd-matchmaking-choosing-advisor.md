## Choosing a PhD Program: Lessons learned as an undergraduate

In high school, I had no idea how to determine which schools would be best for me to attend for college. With an absence of guidance and information, I defaulted to looking at rankings published by the likes of [U.S. News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/education?int=top_nav_Education) as well as the opinions of my mentors and friends.

To some extent, this was not a bad strategy. For undergraduates, there are many things that are shared across areas of study. Campus culture, extracurricular opportunities, and professional development resources are all central to student success as an undergraduate and tend to be shared across departments.

However, what I failed to understand when I applied to undergraduate school was that **one college can have vastly different reputations based on your chosen field of study**. For example, Purdue University is particularly known for its engineering and science programs in the same way the University of Chicago is known for economics. Both schools are excellent, but if you compare Purdue's economics program to the University of Chicago, there is no contest. 

I give this comparison not to disparage any particular college (I am sure Purdue's economics program is still excellent), but to communicate just how important it is to understand:
1. Your personal interest in different fields of study
2. The reputations of different programs within the colleges you are considering

As a high school student, these can be difficult to discern, particularly the latter. This is generally expected; it's unfamiliar territory when you're in high school! With that said, as a college student or graduate pursuing further education, you're now familiar with higher education as well as your interests. A deep grasp of your personal motivation to attend graduate school is central to your success.

## Narrowing your Search: Heuristics for PhD success

This leads us to the best way to search for graduates schools. First and foremost, I recommend that you no longer consider your search to be at the school level. **For a PhD, your search is for an advisor**. As a close second, your search is also for a good lab environment and a secure source of funding.

> Recognizing a great advisor from a distance is incredibly difficult

As easy as this sounds, recognizing a great advisor (and lab) from a distance is incredibly difficult. There is no tour of graduate labs before you are accepted to a school, and internet biographies tell you nothing about someone's personality. The quality of your PhD experience is very much tied to your relationship to your advisor, so how should you start honing on the best place for you?

To begin, I recommend going to the a computer science program rankings site, [CS Rankings](www.csrankings.com) (I am not sure if an equivalent exists for other fields, but it should!). Now, before thinking that I am contradicting myself about rankings, let me finish -- **CS Rankings looks at each schools reputation as an aggregation of their professors' success**. Each professor (which serves as a proxy for their lab) is ranked based on the number of publications are are placing in top conferences. This website does not encompass an exact science; there are many journals and conferences that are not included. Moreover, graduate student success is not necessarily tied to the success of his or her professor (though certainly they are correlated). Even so, this ranking automatically links the personal websites of professors, which gives the most granular, tailored information about a lab that you can get. Find a program with a good reputation within your field of choice, then **scour these biographies** and take notes. You will be glad you did.

## Hidden Gems and Hype: How to pick the best PhD program for you

In particular, taking a tailored approach to your PhD search helps you uncover **hidden gems** and protects you from the **hype monster**. What are these? A hidden gem is a professor who is particularly successful and prodigious in your field, but works at a school that is not widely reknowned. Because of CS Rankings and other resources, these are becoming rarer, but in my opinion they still exist (e.g. for ML: Oregon State, University of Maryland, UMass Amherst...). Because fewer people immediately associate these school with prestige than, say, Stanford, there is a smaller applicant pool that professors can choose from. Getting in will still be difficult, but it could make the difference for you. 

> A hidden gem is a professor who is particularly successful and prodigious in your field, but works at a school that is not widely reknowned

By contast, the **hype monster** is the opposite, and occurs when a very prestigious school's reputation in your specific field is overshadowed by its success in others. For example, many people associate Harvard with . They are not wrong to do so, Harvard is a staple of American education. However, if you had to choose between pursuing a Machine learning PhD at Harvard versus the University of Illinois, what is your gut reaction? If you say Harvard, then you have not done your research. Do yourself a favor and explore your specific program in depth. It will keep the hype monster at bay.

## Digging Deeper: Refining your search and being a PhD detective

Most professors explicitly ask PhD applicants to not contact them directly unless they have been admitted by the school. They are simply too busy to field calls and emails from interested students. This poses a problem if you want to familiarize yourself with a lab and its culture. 

A simple, yet very effective way to overcome this is to politely reach out to current graduate students in their lab. Will they be busy too? You bet. Still, if you can humbly ask for 10 minutes of their time you just might get it. These students have firsthand experience working with your advisor of interest; have questions ready and learn everything you can. Graduate students also have no reason to mislead you, and will be more inclined to share any unsavory details about their experience if you press them.

As you go through this labor intensive process, be sure to start early and keep a log of your progress. It would certainly not be appreciated if you reached out to the same burnt out PhD student twice because you forgot you already contacted them. These people may be your peers, don't start off on the wrong foot.

Additionally, a simple spreadsheet offers an unparalleled basis for comparison across these groups, which may be structured differently and vary in how forthcoming they are with information for applicants. Do you best to recognize gaps in your understanding and fill them.

## The Last Step: Prioritize and tailor your applications

You only have so much money and time; there is no way to apply to all of the schools that interest you. In my case, I applied to 14 schools after making a spreadsheet comparing roughly 40 institutions across the United States. Your figures may be larger or smaller depending on your situation, but I recommend that you explore at least 2x the schools you intend to apply to. 

> No one wants to go to a school below their potential, but even fewer want to be unanimously rejected

At this point, you need to do some self-assessment. No one wants to go to a school below their potential, but even fewer want to be unanimously rejected. Be candid in reviewing your candidacy and invite the same feedback from others whose opinion you trust. Using this technique, I would prune your final application list to include 15% far-reach schools, 65% mid-reach schools, and 20% safe schools. Let's face it, almost every PhD program can be considered a reach if you view it by the numbers. With that in mind, develop a strong bank of schools that you consider just at or above your pay-grade, and shoot for the stars. The safety schools you applied to can help you sleep at night, and the far-reach schools give you a chance at winning the lottery.

Just as you tailored your research to specific advisors, be sure to do the same with your personal statements and ancillary application materials. Do you need to become an expert in that professor's research? No, that would be intractable and overkill. All the same, get a feeling for their current and past research interests and make note. You can mention that information in your statements directly and it might go a long way.

## Coming Up: Determining the best time to attend graduate school

Having the ability to sniff out great PhD advisors is incredibly useful, but it is incomplete without planning a timeline for when you will enroll. Some recommend going to graduate school straight out of undergrad and keeping continuity with your academic study. Others tout the benefits of gaining perspective in industry first. Shortly, we will cross compare these ideas and help discern which time is best for you.
