#### Machine Learning: A curiously obscure field

When I first heard the words *Machine Learning*, I was an intern for the Data Analytics affiliate of Kroger Stores, 84.51&deg;. A rising college junior, I had never ventured beyond Excel for statistical modeling. Here, I spent most of my time querying and organizing basic statistics with SQL, a task well out of my comfort zone. One day, a few of the more tech-savvy interns told me about their "_machine learning_" projects: customer segmentation, demand forecasting, other words I did not understand.

What I did understand, though, was that this stuff was fascinating. "The program _predicts_ how much people will buy next week?! And you built this in three weeks?" At least at first, these systems seemed as close to magic as any technology I had ever seen.

However, when I pressed for details on how their programs worked, the confusion started. What is the "K" in K-means clustering? What does SVM stand for again? This was incredibly frustrating for me. I was a math major, why couldn't I grasp what they were talking about? Phrases like "centroids", "tokenization", "one-hot encoding", and "softmax" left me clueless as to the underlying mechanics of their work.

#### A game of translation

This was my first lesson in Machine Learning and the imposter syndrome that can come with it: vocabulary. In my experience, vocabulary is one of the most confusing aspects of Machine Learning, especially for novices. Most people have heard of a matrix, but what about a _tensor_? I had heard of the idea of dummy variables in school, but never _one-hot encoding_ (hint: they are essentially the same).

Thus, much of my time spent learning ML over the next few years involved translating topics from math or computer science into their machine learning equivalents. Now, a good grasp of vocabulary will not make you a data science master, but it certainly will accelerate your journey. The question remains though: how do you acquire these skills in the first place?

#### Filling the gaps: Self-study

While the title of this blog was not meant to be misleading, formal education is *not* the only way to break into machine learning. Online courses, bootcamps, self-study - all of these can prepare you for a good (or even great!) ML job. With that said, I would like to add the following cautions for taking this non-traiditonal route.
- Self-study can (and does) have many hazards. There is no shortage of YouTube tutorials or Medium.com how-to articles for Machine Learning. What there _is_ a shortage of, however, is quality control. Always trust, but verify!
- While online degrees affiliated with a reputable university carry essentially the same prestige as an in-person program, company-based programs vary considerably in their quality and preceived worth. 
    + Most of these courses can be taken for free, with the answers readily available for anyone who can do a Google search. 
- Only original self-led projects tend to hold water in Machine Learning interviews. No one is going to be impressed by your stack-overflow copy-pasta.
    + To be clear, copy-pasta is ok for learning purposes and in moderation. Just don't bring up those projects in an interview.

#### Formal education and Machine Learning careers

In my Machine Learning journey, I did hundreds of hours of self-study. Projects, tutorials, videos, porting code from existing projects, you name it. However, I can say confidently that there is no educational replacement for completing projects in a professional or academic setting.

With this in mind, let's shift our focus to a more traditional path to machine learning: getting a degree. It is no secret that getting a college degree is the single most common pre-requisite for attaining a competitive job. Is it impossible to break into Machine Learning without one? No, absolutely not. But it will be much, _much_ more difficult.

Moreover, graduate degrees are increasingly common for Machine Learning practitioners and researchers, with a Bachelor's degree considered a fairly strict requirement. The primary education routes one can take are listed below:

1. Bachelor's Degree 
- Does not need to be in Computer Science, but is *very* helpful for industry recognition if you attained a STEM degree
- A Bachelor's of Arts or Science are both accepted, though a Bachelor's of Science will be seen as more desirable
- Regardless of your degree, you will need to demonstrate proficiency in programming and a solid grasp of basic math (statistics, linear algebra, vector calculus)
- For getting a ML job right out of school, your project work, grades, previous internships, and the reputation of your program will contribute the most heavily to your success (aside from your interviews, of course)

2. _Professional_ Master's degree in Data Science / Business Analytics / Computer Science / Applied Math ...
    - Tend to take 1-2 years and can be online or in-person
    - Structured for people who intend to graduate straight into industry and not go for a PhD
    - Emphasis is placed on project-oriented coursework and less on theory and research
    - Tend to be expensive programs (70 - 120k in total)
    
3. _Thesis_ Master's degree in Data Science / Analytics / Computer Science / Applied Math ...
    - Tend to take ~2 years, predominantly in-person instruction
    - Provide a nice mix of coursework and research
    - Emphasis is placed more on research conducted with a research advisor
    - Can feed naturally into a PhD
    - Expensive programs, but have some funding possibilities (TA, paid research)

4. PhD in Computer Science with a focus in Machine Learning / AI / Data Science ...
    - Tend to take 4.5+ years, in-person instruction
    - Heavily focused on research
    - Will attain a research-oriented Master's degree _in-passing_ if you do not already have one (~2-3 years)
    - 2.5+ years of rigorous research, eventually self-guided
    - Requirement for becoming a professor
    - **Almost always fully funded**: Program is seen as a research position and participants are paid for teaching or conducting research

Each of these education paths opens you up to different opportunities career-wise. Let's now examine the main types of machine learning positions in industry and academia today.

**Machine Learning Practitioners** 
- Data Scientists
- Machine Learning Engineers
- Data Science / Technology Consultants

These are people that implement methods and algorithms that have been deemed effective by researchers for a particular task. Their emphasis is more centered around engineering and architecture. Less time is spent investigating the underlying theory and statistics behind their approach. For those with just a Bachelor's degree, this is the most common type of career that is attainable. The most competitive positions in this group certainly prefer greater education (Master's, PhD) but a lack of research is not necessarily seen as detrimental.

**Machine Learning Researchers** 
- Industry Research Scientists (Google Brain, DeepMind, OpenAI...)
- Researchers in a National Lab (NIST, Argonne, Lawrence Livermore...)
- Professors
- Post-Docs (PhD graduates completing research in a new group - Professors in training)

These positions are heavily centered around research. The education requirement is much higher, usually a Master's degree minimum with some experience conducting research. For the most competitive of these positions, particularly Professorship, a PhD is a requirement. These are people who examine existing methods at the cutting edge of Machine Learning and extend them. The systems they create tend to be new and novel, not a replication of existing work.

#### Choosing your path: My story

Clearly, there are many paths to Machine Learning, and choosing the right one for you can be difficult. For me, I was drawn to the PhD route for the following reasons:
1. I got a liberal arts degree from a non-target school. I did not major in Computer Science and found it difficult to convince companies I was suited for a Machine Learning job.
2. Even after landing a Data Science job, I could see a ceiling for my career progression, caused both by my lack of a graduate degree and actual Machine Learning skills.
3. Graduate education is increasingly required to attain competitive Machine Learning positions. This shows no sign of reversing or slowing down.
4. I love research and the idea of **creating** cutting edge systems. I spent two years in industry applying existing methods, a practice I found stifled my creativity.

For you, I recommend choosing your own path the following way. 
1. Make a list of what you would like out of a job. 
2. Then, list your current ML skills as well as how much formal education you have. The stronger your skills, the less likely you will need an additional degree to convince someone of your abilities. 

However, perhaps you want another degree anyway because, like me, you like to learn. If this is the case, I recommend looking in to programs where you can secure funding, usually a thesis Master's or a PhD. Worrying about loans can really take the fun out of school. Think carefully though, what you don't pay with money, you pay with time :).
