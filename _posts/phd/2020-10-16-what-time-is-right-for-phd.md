## A dubious proposition

Picture this: You're a college graduate with a brand new job. Maybe you work for a start up, or a large corporation, or a chic consulting firm downtown. This is your first taste of earning real money and living on your own outside of college. 

One day, someone comes up to you and says: "Hey there! How would you like to cut your earnings in half and work 10+ more hours a week?" Not so appealing? While crude and non-specific, this embodies some of what returning to graduate school is like after spending time in industry. Before you tear up your application, however, hear me out. There are several other reasons why many people (including myself) chose to wait a few years after college to attend graduate school.

## Does timing matter? Dissenting opinions

Timing certainly has _some_ bearing on your success in a PhD program, though how much it will influence you specifically depends on your personality and working style. In general, most recommend enrolling in a PhD program while the concepts you learned in undergrad are relatively fresh in your mind. However, there are many ways to interpret this statement. For those that actively apply their undergraduate classes in their job, it may make sense to actually **wait longer**, allow yourself time to learn from experience and build up your resume. Periodically refreshing the topics you plan to use in graduate school can also bridge this gap (what I did).

In my experience, there are roughly two schools of thought when it comes to  timing a PhD: 
1. Planning to attend right after you finish your undergraduate degree
2. Wait a few (or, in some cases, several) years to enroll, getting industry and real-world experience in the process.

To that end, opponents of either strategy usually state something like the following (respectively):
1.  Going straight from undergrad to a PhD does not give you adequate time to explore your interests or gain real-world perspective. If you are not 100% sure of your chosen specialty, then you risk losing motivation in your PhD and (_insert scary music_) dropping out.
2.  By going into industry instead of directly to a PhD, you are getting a taste of the good life. What you learned as an undergraduate will begin to ooze our of your brain. Once you re-enroll in a graduate program, the lifestyle adjustment and academic rigor will be so harsh that you will get discouraged and eventually (_insert scary music_) drop out.

Both of these statements are dramatic and never exactly true on a case-by-case basis. Does that mean there is no truth to them at all? **No**, but there will always be reasons to not do something. What is more important is your reason for attending. Let's start there.

## Understanding your passion

Everyone who is drawn to a PhD has their own unique set of reasons. Perhaps they love learning, or care deeply about pursuing a research career. A PhD is the most specialized degree you can attain, so a deep-seated understanding of your interests is paramount to success in the program. Do you need to know the exact specialty you want to pursue in your PhD before you apply? No, but you should want _a specialty_ and be willing to spend several years attaining it.

## Reframing the adage of the college dropout

Determining if you want to be specialized is not easy. Many factors can shape your decision. Perhaps you are considering a PhD because:
- You see specializing as a means for you to attain the career you want
- You loved your undergraduate research experiences, and feel that is a strong proxy for graduate school
- A mentor of yours, whom you repect and admire, pursued a PhD and has told you that specialization would be a good match for your interests.

The issue with these motivations is that they can shift over time. One day, you may find a way to attain your dream career without a PhD. After a few years of research, you might find that a PhD is simply not what you expected. As insightful as your mentor was, it's possible he or she did not fully understand your personality. Regardless of the reason, many find something that eventually leads them to drop out of their PhD, usually between years 2 and 3.

Why am I mentioning all of this? Because dropping out of a PhD is not the same as dropping out of undergrad or high school. You are already educated, and the likelihood that you can support yourself financially without a PhD is high. **Putting pressure on yourself to complete a PhD for the sake of finishing alone is bad and counterproductive**. Don't immediately consider dropping out a _failure_. If you review your reasons it may be better characterized as a mature decision to re-align your interests. In fact, it is possible to leave a PhD and still get a Master's degree in the process, though you should not enter a PhD with this plan (that is what Master's programs are for).

> Putting pressure on yourself to complete a PhD for the sake of finishing alone is bad and counterproductive

Recognizing that you are not trapped in a PhD is, in my opinion, one of the first things you need to do in order to develop a healthy relationship with (and eventually graduate from) graduate school. PhDs can be very rigorous, isolating, and frustrating, to put it lightly. Realizing that it is your choice to continue allows you to work from a place of passion instead of a fear of failure.

## Weighing the pros and cons

Let's now list out some of the pros and cons for determining when to enroll in a PhD, starting with **enrolling immediately after undergrad**
- Pros:
    + Coursework still relatively fresh
    + Similar lifestyles (maintin poverty status :) )
    + (Usually) Do not have responsibilities outside of yourself (kids, wife, husand, etc.)
    + Don't waste time in getting your degrees and pursuing your passion
- Cons:
    + Lack perspective gained from an independent, non-college lifestyle
    + Don't know what a full-time industry job is like (tough to know that you won't like it)
    + Lack any savings to fall back on to pad PhD budget


Now, let's consider **waiting to enroll**. In most cases, people wait between 1-5 years before returning. Waiting longer that this poses its own set of problems that I do not feel qualified to speak to, so let's consider this case in isolation.
- Pros:
    + Understand the rigors and lifestyle of someone working in industry
    + Develop soft-skills that may be beneficial in graduate school (proactivity, collaboration, etc.)
    + Have built up some savings from working to assist a PhD budget
    + Get extra time to explore and determine your passion if you do not know it
- Cons:
    + Much harder lifestyle adjustment compared to when you were a student
    + More likely to have additional commitments outside of yourself (kids, wife, husand, etc.)
    + Course material no longer as fresh as it was as a student

To different people, each of these lists may grow or shrink; only the most general characteristics of each option are listed. In truth, only you can figure out the perfect route for your specific situation, though hopefully this list gives you a good starting point. Sometimes, it helps to hear someone else explain their logic.

## Waiting for a sign: Why I chose to wait to get my PhD

As an undergraduate, I changed majors 3 times. When it comes to academic decisions, I am far from decisive. However, what I lacked in decisiveness I made up with conviction. It took me a long time to find my passion for Machine Learning, but since then my passion remains unchanged.

My choice to wait on enrolling a PhD then may come as a surprise. If I am so convicted, why not enroll right away? First, I wanted to see if I could enter the field of Machine Learning and get my dream job without a PhD. When I got an offer to work in Data Science at West Monroe Partners, I felt this would be a good start. Though my work was not cutting edge, it fit my interests well enough for me to postpone graduate school.

Second, I wanted to give myself time to explore Data Science in other industries. Depending on the field, Machine Learning can take many different forms. I saw consulting as a chance to taste all of them without sticking with one indefinitely.

Moreover, I felt I could improve my candidacy by completing industry projects and learning more about machine learning through independent research. Though I cannot prove it, I do think that my time as a consultant helped my candidacy. In fact, some professors look for industry experience specifically.

Lastly, I wanted to save up some money and gain a bit of financial freedom in case I found graduate school to be a bad fit. If eventually I found a Master's program better suited my needs (or I was rejected from PhD programs), then I would have a little capital to put towards my tuition, cutting down on any future loans I might take.

## Coming up: The first 3 months - What to expect as a PhD student

So you have picked a year, chosen your programs, gathered your materials, been accepted, and enrolled in a program. Congratulations! My next post will summarize my first three months as a graduate student. Hopefully, the lessons I learned as a new student can give you an idea of what to expect.
